Type : Creational
Purpose: Provide an interface for creating families of related 
		or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
		
One hierarchal abstract class instantiates the appropriate classes. 
Great for automation and protection from client's wanting to touch java classes
Disadvantage: If additional concrete or attributes need to be added, must implement Factory for that particular attribute or feature;
	e.g. if lights were esse added... new Lights hierarchy: CarLight and VanLight
