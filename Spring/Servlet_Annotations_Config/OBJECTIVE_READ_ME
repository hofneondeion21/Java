THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO USE ANNOTATIONS

THIS EXERCISE WILL DEMO ANOTHER WAY TO RUN AND CALL SERVLETS VIA ANNOTATIONS

IN THE WEB.XML FILE, THAT IS A WAY TO CALL AND TRANSFER INFO FROM SERVLET TO SERVLET, 

ANNOTATIONS ARE THE PREFERED METHOD AS IT IS ALL IN ONE FILE, JAVA FILE, AND IS MUCH CLEANER

WEB.XML WILL COMMENT OUT THE VARIOUS HOPS AND CALLS TO EACH SERVLET, TO SHOW THE ORIGINAL SERVLET CALLS

USING ANNOTATIONS WILL REDUCE THE USER'S WORK COMPARED WHEN USING THE XML
